The goal of `crudr` is to simplifying creating crud processing, including tracking 
deltas in db tables.

## Installation
`crudr` is not available from CRAN yet. In the meantime, you can install the development version of crudr from Github:


```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("eauleaf/crudr")
```
